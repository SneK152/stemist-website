## What is STEMist?

STEMist is a 501(c)3 nonprofit based at Lynbrook High School. Founded in the summer of 2020, its goal of teaching kids STEM is supported by over 30 volunteers who teach classes and manage the organization. In addition to teaching classes, it also supports STEM education in many other ways such as hosting a Youtube channel and organizing a hackathon. Over the summer of 2022, STEMist raised over $1,200 for charity and taught over 30 hour-long classes.
