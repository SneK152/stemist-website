          STEMist{"'"}s Computer Science course is highly rigorous, teaching
          languages Python, C++, and Javascript. Our thorough lessons don{"'"}t
          just teach students to memorize languages, but help them understand
          the thought process and reasoning behind different syntax. After
          learning the fundamentals, students take a deep dive into the
          applications of computer science, including algorithmic thinking,
          which is the premise of most programming contests, like USACO. We
          teach topics that students have heard about, like machine learning,
          and creating websites with web development, both of which help
          students succeed in hackathons. Our qualified instructors have
          experience with multiple facets of computer science, ranging from
          USACO Silver and Gold competitors to multiple-time hackathon winners.
          Our curriculum helps students learn to like computer science, and
          helps them get interested in pursuing it further.

          STEMist{"'"}s Physical Science covers a broad range of topics in
          Physics, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Astronomy. Presentations will
          go over the basics over the topic and show applications of the
          extensive material provided through the form of sample problems and
          explanations. Explanations will include information that is easily
          broken down into different segments to best prepare students in the
          subject matter. Our instructors include contestants and award winners
          through various physical science-related competitions and olympiads in
          science-related subjects including a combined 20+ years of Science
          Olympiad, Science Bowl, and Ocean Science Bowl experience winning
          dozens of medals and trophies. Instructors are familiar with teaching
          with all have past experience and willing to answer questions where
          students have lapses in understanding.

          STEMist{"'"}s Intro to Biology is a comprehensive course which not
          only provides an introduction to the knowledge required for science
          competitions (including USABO, Science Bowl and Science Olympiad), but
          also delves deep into various fascinating topics (like oncology and
          immunology). Our curriculum covers biochemistry, molecular and cell
          biology, genetics, botany, anatomy, evolution and ethology, and
          ecology, touching upon all of the subjects covered in biolympiads and
          high school or AP biology courses. Our instructors are highly
          qualified, winning awards in many different contests (USABO
          semfinalists, Science Bowl competitors, Science Olympiad medalists,
          etc.). They also have more than two years of teaching experience, and
          are always happy to answer questions or explain tricky topics.

          Welcome to the math branch of STEMist! Here, you
          {"'"}ll dive into the fundamentals of competition math. Our curriculum
          has been carefully designed to cover the 4 main topics that appear in
          math contests: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Number Theory.
          Whilst in classes, students can not only expect to be taught necessary
          skills, but also be taught to apply these skills through challenging
          and rewarding problems. Our instructors are tremendously qualified,
          having won many high-level awards in contests like the AMC 8/10/12 and
          Math Kangaroo, and have qualified for the AIME numerous amount of
          times. They have more than a year of teaching experience and are
          always open to answering any difficult questions that may come with
          the twists and turns of mathematics.
